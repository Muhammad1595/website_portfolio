<p1>Covid-19 was declared a pandemic by the WHO on 11th March 2020. Since then, it has greatly disrupted normal life and caused a change in the lifestyle of people. 
Offices and schools were shut down, global air travel was restricted, many more were some of the changes people experienced because of the pandemic.
<br>During the lockdown time,students were attending schools from the comfort of their houses, thereby saving travel time of 1-2 hours. I decided to use this precious time saved to learn new skills. In my E-Portfolio, I will be sharing some things I have learnt in the academic year 2020-2021.</br>

<ul>
<li>Programming:-It is one of my most favourite things to do. I had learnt programming from IBM courses provided by the school and classes taken by Valsamma ma'am. I have created an app and a game using my learned skills.Below is the image of all my badges I received from IBM for the courses I did.

<br>I have also created a game on scratch titled " Catch the fruit ". Read the instructions and enjoy playing it.</br>
<b>
<br>Instructions:-</br>
<br>Left Key to move left</br>
<br>Right Key to move right</br>
<br>Green flag to start</br>
<br>Red octagon to stop</br>

<li>Robotics:- It helped me develop problem solving skills and creativity. I had worked on a robot called Mbot. I learnt how to assemble it, program it, and use various sensors. I learnt how to program it using mblock 5 software. In the app, I was able to program it using blocks or Arduino C language. Now, I can uses various sensors such as Ultrasonic sensor, Line follower sensor, Touch sensor, Light sensor and temperature sensor. I have attached a video for your reference to show what my robot can do.
